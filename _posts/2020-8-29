title: My first experience with Golang: Publishing on a Facebook page from an RSS news feed.
---

I've always been suspicious about golang even if the web is full of people talking about it. So I decided to try it for a simple project.
I wanted to build a small code to publish on a facebook page the items fetched from a news feed (in particular Google RSS News Feed).
I did it in Go, and I admit it has been a surprise to see how fast the development has been. I have a bit of experience with C# and I love Elixir as functional language, but I mostly use Python so coming from Python syntax
the simplicity of the Go's syntax for me was not really interesting, and I did not quite like it before developing this project.
It felt strange to me to declare a variable using the ":=" symbols, or importing modules withous using the comma, and start the for loop that looks like C based one but without the needing of parenthesis.
Anyway I loved the way the compiler works and the ability of building the code to an executable avoiding all the burdains of installing libraries on other machines.
Finally I must say: I like GO.

The project:

To publish on a Facebook page it is necessary to have the right permissions from Facebook.

First step: Create a Facebook Short Lived User Access Token

To create a short lived user token we can use:
- Graph Explorer tool
- Facebook Login Dialog
